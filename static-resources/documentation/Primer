    The number one rule in site design is to start with the fucntion. Clearly
    define the audience and what you're trying to communicate. The message
    will help to define and focus the structure and the audience will help
    define and focus the style.

    A website consists of 'pages'. Pages may be broken into two broad
    categories: content and navigation. Navigation pages may contain some
    content, but their primary purpose is to help users navigate to other
    pages. Conversely, all pages, including content pages, have navigation
    elements, but their primary purpose is to provide content.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The most important navigation page is generlly
    the <a href="/documentation/web-style-primer/ref/Front-Page-Design">front
    page</a>. This is both the primary entry and, when well desingned, a
    useful jumping off point for every activity a user might perform on the
    site.

  <div class="p">
    Clear <a href="/documentation/web-style-primer/ref/Navigation-Strategies">navigation
    strategies</a> allow a user to intuitively understand how to get around
    your website. Navigation should be as simple as possible (but not
    simpler). Typical navigation consists of omni-present links to common
    jumping off points, with 'local navigation' elemnts for access to related
    pages.

    Style used to be about colors and 'flat vs. 3D', rounded vs. sharp,
    etc. While these kind

    CSS framework</a>. The framework may be organic or pre-existing, but it
    should always be there and it should always be grid based.
